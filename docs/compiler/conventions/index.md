# Conventions

The Luvascript Compiler follows the [Luvascript Language Specification](../../language-specifications/index.md). The Luvascript Language Specification is a set of rules that define the syntax and semantics of the Luvascript language.
But the Compiler also follows conventions when generating assembly code. Namely, the [`Luvascript Naming Convention (LNC)`](./luvascript-naming-convention.md) is used.
